# Depth_from_Stereo
A depth estimation application using two stereo images

Developed application for depth estimation using stereo images. Firstly the depth was estimated using the NCC metric on the given window size and disparity range. Following this, a dynamic programming-based approach was implemented based on "A Maximum Likelihood Stereo Algorithm", INGEMAR J. COX, SUNITA L. HINGORANI, and SATISH B. RAO.
It was found that for the same window size and disparity range, the results obtained with the dynamic programming approach were much better.
